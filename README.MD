# PIC 16F676 & LM35 thermometer, in C

This is an simple, low cost thermometer project intended for embedded C studies, using an LM35 temperature sensor.

It was designed using two digits 7 segment LED displays for temperature show.

The software was written in CCS C - it is not exactly as a C standard language.
